What if you could replay the same block twice?
Every transaction arrives out of order
The gas price is infinite
Assume the timestamp can be manipulated
What if miners could see your transaction before anyone else?
You control 1% of the validators, what's possible?
The price oracle is always wrong
Make the token deflate faster than intended
Every address is a contract
What happens between block confirmations?
Reorder everything that can be reordered
What if you could predict the next random number?
Force it to revert halfway
The upgrade proxy points the wrong way
Make the cheapest operation the most expensive
What happens at the edge of uint256?
You can only front-run, never back-run
The constructor never finished
Every call must go through another contract first
What if ETH was worth zero?
Make governance vote against itself
The oldest transaction wins
You can only interact through delegatecalls
The fallback function is the only function
The base fee makes no sense
The same account appears twice in one instruction
