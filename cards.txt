Start by reading the git history
How could an old bug come back?
Find the code that the developer hates the most

What if all input was sent in reverse?
First, read the documentation of the dependencies
Assume the math is wrong
Slowly, then all at once
What if it was done your way?
Write the proof-of-concept before finding the exploit
Stop at once. Sleep on it
Go offline
Where is the best place to hide?
Use unacceptable numbers
Change the encoding
How could corruption impact reliability? How could unreliability cause corruption?
The developer lets you change 20 lines of code

The dependencies are broken
One window, one tab, one screen
Do the comments tell the whole story?
The innocent TODO is a critical
Articulate hidden cycles
How can the state machine move backward?
Reverse the flow
By any means necessary, try all combinations

What's the smallest change that could cause the most damage?
Replace all strings with emojis
The attacker can only use printable ASCII
Imagine the system was built upside down
What if memory never freed?
You can only move data, not modify it
The compiler is compromised
Every third request fails
Time moves backwards
Treat warnings as features
What if you could only use environment variables?
The documentation is in a language you don't speak
Every function must return true
Write the exploit without using numbers
What happens at the edge of integer space?
The system is perfect except for one thing
The API is rate limited to one call per hour
What if NULL was a valid value everywhere?
The bug only reproduces in leap years
What if the entropy was predictable?
Transform valid input until it becomes invalid

Use a different operating system for this task
Approach this as if you were 12 years old
What would happen if you had infinite time?
Solve this using only command line tools
What would the victim think is impossible?
Assume the obvious solution is a trap
What if this system was designed by your enemy?
Look for what everyone else is ignoring
What would break if you were too successful?
Start from the error messages
Map the trust boundaries first
Follow the money, not the code
What assumptions does the developer make about users?
Find the code that runs at 3 AM
Embrace the uncomfortable silence
What if security was an illusion?
The most dangerous code is the code that works
Trust nothing, verify everything, doubt verification
What would you do if failure was impossible?
Consider zero
And if it was negative?
The length is a lie
A limitless input, and its opportunities
